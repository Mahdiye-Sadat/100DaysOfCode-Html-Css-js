<h2>About me</h2>
<strong>
I am a passionate self-taught developer who enjoys building web projects and exploring new technologies. I love working with HTML and CSS to create clean, structured designs, and Iâ€™m currently improving my skills in Git and GitHub to collaborate and share my work. I also enjoy experimenting with Linux environments and learning step-by-step, focusing on building strong fundamentals before moving to advanced topics.
